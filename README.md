this is the arduino code for shokudachi
by Fariz Hirzan

with this code we can convert the data output from soil moisture sensor and photoresistor into an emoticon so we can interact with our plants.
in addition to that, we can also track our plants well-being by monitoring the water and light level within the 8x8 LED monitor.
